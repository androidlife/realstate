A demo app containing MVP architecture using Kotlin and RxJava. 
The MVP contract can be seen in ListContract. The app has two layout configuration for devices with 600dp screen size. For 600 dp and more screen size, it comes in two panes ( listing and detail view ). For other there will be a single pane containing listing only and when item is clicked goes to DetailActivity. Added some UI testing with Espresso and unit testing using Junit and Mockito-Kotlin. For activity lifecycle handling, during onPause and onResume, presenter is configured and during orientation change, the view has certain state which are preserved on savedinstance state and restored on restoreinstance of activity.
